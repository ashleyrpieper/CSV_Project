# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib

csv_temps_1 shows only the high temperatures from Sitka

csv_temps_2 incorporates the date of each temperature reading

csv_temps_3 groups the dates, includes low temperatures, and shades the area between high & low

csv_temps_4 shows the daily temperatures for Death Valley

csv_temps_5 should show both the temperatures from Sitka and Death Valley. Unfortunately I think I worked on the assignment for so long I started confusing myself and couldn't get the finalized project.
